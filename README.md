# EmployeeDirectory



## Description 
    
This Employee Directory will provide you with a list of Employees, phone numbers, emails, and dates of birth.  This would be a good tool for managers or HR personel in larger companies.

This application uses a front end implemented with HTML/CSS and an API to return a list of employees that is searchable and sortable by the first name..

The search will search on keystroke so no need for a search button.  Clicking on the First Name table heading will sort assending first then if clicked again it will sort desending.
